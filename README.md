# Law-of-Causality
(Really should be called the `Law of Anti-Causality`)

The Law of Causality, philosophically and mathematically proposed as follows:

---

## Philosophical Statement
**Law: Causality**  

"The states of a system are determined not solely by antecedent conditions but also by a time-symmetric or relational framework, where future states, external influences, or emergent patterns influence the present and past without strict causal precedence."

---

## Mathematical Representation
1. **Time-Symmetric Dynamics**:  
   Redefine Newton's second law \( F = ma \) to include time-symmetric terms:  
```math
   F(t) = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \alpha m \frac{d^2x}{d(-t)^2}
``` 
   Here, $\alpha$ represents the degree of anti-causal influence.

2. **Emergent Influence**:  
   Introduce a relational operator $R$, where $R(x)$ models system-wide emergent influences:  
```math
   F = R(x) \cdot m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
```

3. **Retrocausality**:  
   Allow effects from $t_f > t$ to influence $t$, where $G(t', t)$ is a retrocausal kernel.
```math
   x(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} G(t', t) F(t') \, dt'
``` 
   
---

## Physical Interpretation
In systems governed by this law, events could:
- Emerge without specific precursors (akin to stochastic phenomena).
- Be influenced by conditions yet to manifest (retrocausality).
- Exhibit holistic behaviors where causality is distributed across time and space.

## Expansion on the Mathematical Derivation and Implications

### **Mathematical Derivation**

1. **Time-Symmetric Dynamics**:
   The term $\alpha m \frac{d^2x}{d(-t)^2}$ reflects an "anti-causal" influence, which considers the retrograde temporal derivative. In practice, it models forces that depend symmetrically on forward and backward time:
```math
   F = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \alpha m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\Big|_{t \to -t}
```
   Here, $\alpha$ is a tunable parameter that regulates how much the system respects anti-causal effects.

2. **Emergent Influence Operator**:
   The relational operator $R(x)$ accounts for global, time-independent influences across the system. Where $\phi(x, t)$ is a potential field influenced by the state of the entire system.
```math
   R(x) = \nabla \cdot \phi(x, t)
```

3. **Retrocausal Kernel**:
   The retrocausal kernel $G(t', t)$ integrates effects over a time interval $[t_0, t_f]$, treating $t' > t$ contributions as valid inputs, where $\tau$ is a time-scale of retrocausal propagation.
```math
   G(t', t) = \exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right)
```

## Derivation for $\frac{d^2x}{d(-t)^2}$

### **1. Concept of the Retrograde Derivative**  
The retrograde derivative is a mathematical construct that evaluates changes with respect to a reversed time parameter $-t$.

Let $x(t)$ be a differentiable function of time $t$.

### **2. First-Order Derivative**
The first-order derivative with respect to $-t$ is given by:
```math
   \frac{dx}{d(-t)} = \frac{dx}{dt} \cdot \frac{dt}{d(-t)} = \frac{dx}{dt} \cdot (-1) = -\frac{dx}{dt}
```

### **3. Second-Order Derivative**
The second-order derivative requires differentiating $\frac{dx}{d(-t)}$ again with respect to $-t$:
```math
   \frac{d^2x}{d(-t)^2} = \frac{d}{d(-t)} \left( -\frac{dx}{dt} \right)
```
Using the chain rule:
```math
   \frac{d^2x}{d(-t)^2} = -\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right) \cdot \frac{dt}{d(-t)}
```
Since $\frac{dt}{d(-t)} = -1$, we have:
```math
   \frac{d^2x}{d(-t)^2} = -\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \cdot (-1) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
```

Thus, the retrograde second derivative is numerically equivalent to the forward-time second derivative, but its inclusion in the dynamics allows the interpretation of symmetry or retrocausal contributions.

## Derivation of the Retrocausal Kernel $G(t', t)$

### **1. General Form of the Kernel**
The retrocausal kernel $G(t', t)$ describes how future forces $F(t')$ influence the present state $x(t)$. It must decay with the time difference $|t' - t|$ and respect causality for $t' < t$.

The kernel is modeled as follows where $\tau$ is the retrocausal time scale.
```math
   G(t', t) = \exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right)
```


### **2. Key Properties**
- **Decaying Influence**: The exponential factor ensures that future influences diminish as $|t' - t|$ grows.
- **Symmetry**: By construction, $G(t', t) = G(t, t')$ when the absolute value is used, highlighting time-symmetric behavior.

### **3. Normalization**
To ensure proper integration, normalize $G(t', t)$ over the interval $[t_0, t_f]$:
```math
   G(t', t) = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right)}{\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right) dt'}
```

### **4. Derivation of the Normalized Kernel**
The denominator is the integral:
```math
   \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right) dt'
```
Split the integral at $t$):
```math
   \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right) dt' = \int_{t_0}^{t} \exp\left(-\frac{t - t'}{\tau}\right) dt' + \int_{t}^{t_f} \exp\left(-\frac{t' - t}{\tau}\right) dt'
```
For the first term:
```math
   \int_{t_0}^{t} \exp\left(-\frac{t - t'}{\tau}\right) dt' = \tau \left[1 - \exp\left(-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}\right)\right]
```
For the second term:
```math
   \int_{t}^{t_f} \exp\left(-\frac{t' - t}{\tau}\right) dt' = \tau \left[1 - \exp\left(-\frac{t_f - t}{\tau}\right)\right]
```
Combining, the denominator becomes:
```math
   \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right) dt' = \tau \left[2 - \exp\left(-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}\right) - \exp\left(-\frac{t_f - t}{\tau}\right)\right]
```

The normalized kernel is:
```math
   G(t', t) = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right)}{\tau \left[2 - \exp\left(-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}\right) - \exp\left(-\frac{t_f - t}{\tau}\right)\right]}
```

---

## Application of $G(t', t)$ in the Retrocausal Framework

The position $x(t)$ is influenced by the forces $F(t')$ over $[t_0, t_f]$:
```math
   x(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} G(t', t) F(t') dt'.
```
Substituting the normalized kernel:
```math
   x(t) = \frac{1}{\tau \left[2 - \exp\left(-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}\right) - \exp\left(-\frac{t_f - t}{\tau}\right)\right]} \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \exp\left(-\frac{|t' - t|}{\tau}\right) F(t') dt'
```
This describes how future and past forces combine to determine the present state, with the weight of influence controlled by $\tau$.

## **Implications in Classical Systems**

1. **Non-Deterministic Evolution**:
   Classical systems might not follow a strict trajectory. Instead, they exhibit probabilistic paths influenced by both past and future conditions.

2. **Delayed Response**:
   Systems could behave as if influenced by outcomes that haven't occurred yet, akin to preemptive adaptation.

---

## **Quantum Analogy**

In quantum mechanics, causality could align with non-local phenomena and entanglement. A time-symmetric wavefunction might unify, indicating retrocausal interactions.
```math
  \psi(x, t) = \psi_{\text{forward}}(x, t) + \psi_{\text{backward}}(x, -t)
```

## Testing the Law of Causality: Physical Examples and Experiments

### **Physical Examples**

1. **Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser**:  
   This experiment already exhibits retrocausal-like behavior where choices made after photon emission appear to affect its prior state. Extending this, introducing a classical analog might explore macroscopic retrocausality.

2. **Self-Organizing Systems**:  
   Use emergent systems like sandpile models or cellular automata, adjusting conditions to measure if outcomes can statistically "influence" earlier configurations.

---

### **Proposed Experiments**

1. **Retrocausal Harmonic Oscillator**:  
   Modify a damped oscillator by introducing a retrograde term and analyze resonances caused by future oscillations.
```math
   x(t) = A\cos(\omega t) + B\cos(\omega(-t))
```
   
2. **Feedback in Coupled Systems**:  
   Design a feedback loop where the output signal depends on delayed and "advanced" inputs. For example, circuits with capacitors and variable delays can simulate retrocausal influences.

## Simulation of setup
The provided code simulates a **retrocausal harmonic oscillator**, where the system's position is influenced by future states. The retrocausal force is modeled by introducing a delay mechanism that computes a contribution from a future timestep (1 second ahead).

Key Features:
- **Retrocausal Term**: Implements the influence from a future state via `retrocausal_force(t_idx)`.
- **Simulation**: Numerically solves the dynamics using a time-stepped approach.
- **Visualization**: Plots the position of the oscillator over time, illustrating the impact of retrocausal feedback.
